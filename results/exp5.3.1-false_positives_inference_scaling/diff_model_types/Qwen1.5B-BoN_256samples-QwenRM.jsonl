Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.","ground_truth":809,"solution":"To determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game's structure. The game is a classic example of a combinatorial game where the player who cannot make a move loses. We will use the concept of winning and losing positions.\n\nA position is called a losing position if the player whose turn it is to move will lose if both players play optimally. Conversely, a position is called a winning position if the player whose turn it is to move will win if both players play optimally.\n\nLet's define \\( P(n) \\) as the position with \\( n \\) tokens. We need to determine whether \\( P(n) \\) is a winning position or a losing position.\n\n1. **Base Cases:**\n   - \\( P(0) \\): If there are 0 tokens, the player whose turn it is to move loses. Therefore, \\( P(0) \\) is a losing position.\n   - \\( P(1) \\): If there is 1 token, the player can remove it and win. Therefore, \\( P(1) \\) is a winning position.\n   - \\( P(2) \\): If there are 2 tokens, the player can remove 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent, who will then win. Therefore, \\( P(2) \\) is a losing position.\n   - \\( P(3) \\): If there are 3 tokens, the player can remove 1 token, leaving 2 tokens for the opponent, who will then lose. Therefore, \\( P(3) \\) is a winning position.\n   - \\( P(4) \\): If there are 4 tokens, the player can remove 4 tokens and win. Therefore, \\( P(4) \\) is a winning position.\n   - \\( P(5) \\): If there are 5 tokens, the player can remove 1 token, leaving 4 tokens for the opponent, who will then win. Therefore, \\( P(5) \\) is a losing position.\n\n2. **Recursive Definition:**\n   - A position \\( P(n) \\) is a losing position if all positions \\( P(n-1) \\) and \\( P(n-4) \\) are winning positions.\n   - A position \\( P(n) \\) is a winning position if at least one of the positions \\( P(n-1) \\) or \\( P(n-4) \\) is a losing position.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - From the base cases, we observe a pattern: \\( P(0), P(2), P(5), P(7), P(10), P(12), \\ldots \\) are losing positions.\n   - We can generalize this pattern by noting that the losing positions are those \\( n \\) for which \\( n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\) or \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\n4. **Counting the Number of Losing Positions:**\n   - We need to count the number of integers \\( n \\) from 1 to 2024 that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\n   - The sequence of numbers congruent to 0 modulo 5 is \\( 5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 2020 \\).

Since 9 is the mode, we need at least two 9's. Let's try to construct a list with the smallest possible number of elements.\n\n#### Case 1: List with 4 elements\n- If we have 4 elements, the list must be symmetric around the median. Let the list be \\(a, b, c, d\\).\n- The median is \\(\\frac{b+c}{2}\\), which must be an integer and not in the list.\n- The mode is 9, so at least two elements must be 9.\n- Let's try \\(9, 9, x, y\\).\n\nSince the sum of the elements is 30:\n\\[ 9 + 9 + x + y = 30 \\]\n\\[ 18 + x + y = 30 \\]\n\\[ x + y = 12 \\]\n\nTo satisfy the median condition, \\(\\frac{x+y}{2}\\) must be an integer and not in the list. Since \\(x + y = 12\\), the median is 6, which is not in the list. Therefore, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must be distinct positive integers that sum to 12.\n\nLet's try \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 7\\):\n\\[ 9, 9, 5, 7 \\]\n\nThis list has a median of 6, which is not in the list, and the mode is 9. This list satisfies all the conditions.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Solution\n- Sum: \\(9 + 9 + 5 + 7 = 30\\)\n- Mode: 9 (unique)\n- Median: 6 (not in the list)\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Sum of the Squares\nNow, we calculate the sum of the squares of all the items in the list:\n\\[ 9^2 + 9^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 \\]\n\\[ = 81 + 81 + 25 + 49 \\]\n\\[ = 236 \\]\n\nThus, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is \\(\\boxed{236}\\).","false_positive":true}

Let's denote the side length of the hexagon by \\(s\\).\n\nFirst, observe that the hexagon can be divided into two congruent trapezoids by drawing the diagonals \\(AD\\), \\(BE\\), and \\(CF\\). Since the hexagon is equilateral and the opposite sides are parallel, the extensions of \\(AB\\), \\(CD\\), and \\(EF\\) form a triangle whose sides are the sums of the lengths of the sides of the hexagon and the extensions of the sides \\(BC\\), \\(DE\\), and \\(FA\\).

Let's denote the elements of \\( A \\) as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\) where \\( a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots < a_n \\).\n\nFor each element \\( a_i \\) in \\( A \\), we can form sets \\( B \\) where \\( a_i \\) is the maximum element. The number of such sets \\( B \\) is the number of subsets of the set \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, a_i-1\\} \\), which is \\( 2^{a_i-1} \\).

First, we find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 2024, which is \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\). Subtracting 1024 from 2024, we get 1000. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 1000 is \\( 2^9 = 512 \\). Subtracting 512 from 1000, we get 488. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 488 is \\( 2^8 = 256 \\). Subtracting 256 from 488, we get 232. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 232 is \\( 2^7 = 128 \\). Subtracting 128 from 232, we get 104. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 104 is \\( 2^6 = 64 \\). Subtracting 64 from 104, we get 40. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 40 is \\( 2^5 = 32 \\).
