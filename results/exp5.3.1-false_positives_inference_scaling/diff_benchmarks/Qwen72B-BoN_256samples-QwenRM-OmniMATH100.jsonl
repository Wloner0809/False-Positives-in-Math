Let's consider the possible roots of unity step by step.\n\n1. **First, consider \\(z = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   z^2 + az + b = 1 + a + b = 0 \\implies a + b = -1.\n   \\]\n   Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, \\(z = 1\\) is a root of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients.\n\n2. **Next, consider \\(z = -1\\):**\n   \\[\n   z^2 + az + b = 1 - a + b = 0 \\implies -a + b = -1 \\implies a - b = 1.\n   \\]\n   Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, \\(z = -1\\) is a root of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients.\n\n3. **Now, consider the primitive 3rd roots of unity, \\(z = \\omega\\) and \\(z = \\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega = e^{2\\pi i \/ 3} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\) and \\(\\omega^2 = e^{-2\\pi i \/ 3} = -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\). These roots satisfy \\(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0\\):**\n   \\[\n   z^2 + z + 1 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 1\\), which are integers, so both \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\) are roots of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients.\n\n4. **Next, consider the primitive 4th roots of unity, \\(z = i\\) and \\(z = -i\\), where \\(i = \\sqrt{-1}\\) and \\(-i = -\\sqrt{-1}\\). These roots satisfy \\(i^2 + 1 = 0\\):**\n   \\[\n   z^2 + 1 = 0.\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = 1\\), which are integers, so both \\(i\\) and \\(-i\\) are roots of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients.\n\n5. **Finally, consider the primitive 6th roots of unity, \\(z = \\omega_6\\) and \\(z = \\omega_6^5\\), where \\(\\omega_6 = e^{2\\pi i \/ 6} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\) and \\(\\omega_6^5 = e^{-2\\pi i \/ 6} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\).

Let's list all such numbers up to 50:\n   - \\(p^3\\): \\(2^3 = 8\\), \\(3^3 = 27\\), \\(5^3 = 125\\) (exceeds 50)\n   - \\(pq\\): \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\), \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\), \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\), \\(2 \\times 11 = 22\\), \\(2 \\times 13 = 26\\), \\(2 \\times 17 = 34\\), \\(2 \\times 19 = 38\\), \\(2 \\times 23 = 46\\), \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\), \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\), \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\), \\(3 \\times 13 = 39\\), \\(5 \\times 7 = 35\\), \\(5 \\times 11 = 55\\) (exceeds 50), \\(7 \\times 11 = 77\\) (exceeds 50)\n   So, the numbers are \\(6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 26, 27, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 46\\). There are 15 such numbers.\n3. **\\(\\tau(n) = 9\\)**: A number \\(n\\) has exactly 9 divisors if it is of the form \\(p^8\\) or \\(p^2 q^2\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are distinct primes. Let's list all such numbers up to 50:\n   - \\(p^8\\): \\(2^8 = 256\\) (exceeds 50)\n   - \\(p^2 q^2\\): \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 = 36\\), \\(2^2 \\times 5^2 = 100\\) (exceeds 50), \\(3^2 \\times 5^2 = 225\\) (exceeds 50)\n   So, the only number is \\(36\\). There is 1 such number.\n\nAdding up all these, we get \\(1 + 15 + 1 = 17\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of integers \\(1 \\leq n \\leq 50\\) such that \\(\\tau(\\tau(n))\\) is odd is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).","false_positive":false}
