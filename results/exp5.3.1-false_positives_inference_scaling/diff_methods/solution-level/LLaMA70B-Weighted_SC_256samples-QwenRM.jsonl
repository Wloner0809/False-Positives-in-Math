Applying this, we can rewrite the equation as $\\sqrt{\\log_b n} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_b n$.\n\n## Step 2: Solve for $\\log_b n$\nFrom the rewritten equation, we can square both sides to get rid of the square root: $(\\sqrt{\\log_b n})^2 = (\\frac{1}{2} \\log_b n)^2$.

This involves finding the probability of winning the grand prize and the probability of winning any prize, then using these to find the conditional probability.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes when 4 numbers are randomly chosen from the set S\nThe total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from a set of 10 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{10}{4} = \\frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = 210$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways Jen can win the grand prize\nFor Jen to win the grand prize, all 4 of her chosen numbers must match the 4 numbers randomly chosen from S. Since she has chosen 4 distinct numbers, there is only 1 way for her numbers to match the randomly chosen numbers.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways Jen can win any prize\nTo win any prize, at least 2 of Jen's numbers must match the randomly chosen numbers. This includes the cases where exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers match. We can calculate these as follows:\n- Exactly 2 numbers match: $\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{2} = 6 \\times 15 = 90$ ways.\n- Exactly 3 numbers match: $\\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{6}{1} = 4 \\times 6 = 24$ ways.\n- Exactly 4 numbers match: $\\binom{4}{4} = 1$ way (already calculated in Step 3).\nTherefore, the total number of ways to win any prize is $90 + 24 + 1 = 115$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize\nThe probability of winning the grand prize is $\\frac{1}{210}$, and the probability of winning any prize is $\\frac{115}{210}$. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{210}}{\\frac{115}{210}} = \\frac{1}{115}$.\n\n## Step 6: Express the probability as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers\nThe probability is already in the simplest form as $\\frac{1}{115}$.\n\n## Step 7: Find $m+n$\n$m = 1$ and $n = 115$, so $m + n = 1 + 115 = 116$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{116}$","false_positive":false}

Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.","ground_truth":73,"solution":"## Step 1: Calculate the total number of residents who own at least one item.\nTo find this, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We start by adding the number of residents who own each item: 195 (diamond ring) + 367 (golf clubs) + 562 (garden spade) + 900 (bag of candy hearts) = 2024.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of residents who own exactly two items.\nWe are given that there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total number of residents who own exactly three items.\nWe are given that there are 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of residents who own all four items using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nLet's denote the number of residents who own all four items as x. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can set up the equation: 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - (number of residents who own exactly two items) - 2 * (number of residents who own exactly three items) - 3x = 900. Substituting the values, we get: 2024 - 437 - 2 * 234 - 3x = 900.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation to find the number of residents who own all four items.\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 2024 - 437 - 468 - 3x = 900.

We need to consider how to approach solving these equations simultaneously.\n\n## Step 2: Manipulate the second equation to simplify\nWe notice that the second equation can be rewritten by factoring out common terms: \\(a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000\\). This manipulation may help in identifying a strategy to solve the problem.\n\n## Step 3: Utilize the first equation to substitute into the manipulated second equation\nSince we know \\(a + b + c = 300\\), we can substitute \\(a + b + c\\) in the manipulated second equation to simplify it further. This gives us \\(a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\\), which simplifies to \\(300a^2 - a^3 + 300b^2 - b^3 + 300c^2 - c^3 = 6,000,000\\).\n\n## Step 4: Notice the form of the equation and relate to known mathematical identities or formulas\nThe equation resembles a form that can be related to the sum of cubes identity, but direct application seems complex. Instead, notice that the equation can be seen as a sum of terms of the form \\(300x^2 - x^3\\), which can be analyzed for its properties.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the equation for constraints on the variables\nTo satisfy the equation, given its form and the constraint that \\(a, b, c\\) are nonnegative integers, we consider the range of possible values for \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\). The equation implies that each term \\(300x^2 - x^3\\) must be nonnegative since the sum is positive and the variables are nonnegative.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the feasible range for the variables\nFor \\(300x^2 - x^3 \\geq 0\\), we solve \\(x^2(300 - x) \\geq 0\\), which implies \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 300\\). Given the nonnegativity and integer constraints, we can analyze the behavior of this function to understand the distribution of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n## Step 7: Solve for the specific values of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\)\nConsidering the symmetry and the constraints, we look for combinations of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\) that satisfy both equations. Given the complexity of directly solving the cubic equation for all possible combinations, we consider specific patterns or distributions of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\) that fulfill the conditions.\n\n## Step 8: Enumerate solutions based on the constraints and equations\nWe realize that due to the symmetry of the equations and the constraints, the solutions will have a pattern. Specifically, we are looking for combinations where the distribution of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\) allows the sum of the squares times the other variable to equal 6,000,000, under the constraint that \\(a + b + c = 300\\).\n\n## Step 9: Consider the implications of the equations on the distribution of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\)\nGiven the constraints and the specific form of the equations, we consider how \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\) must be distributed to satisfy both conditions. This involves analyzing the factors of 6,000,000 and how they can be distributed across \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\) under the constraint \\(a + b + c = 300\\).\n\n## Step 10: Finalize the approach to enumerate solutions\nGiven the complexity and the specific nature of the equations, we realize that the solution involves identifying specific patterns or combinations of \\(a, b,\\) and \\(c\\) that satisfy both the sum constraint and the product-sum constraint.

This is because for an even number of items, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which can be a non-integer or an integer not in the list.\n\n## Step 3:  Consider the mode and its implications.\nThe unique mode of 9 means that 9 occurs more than once in the list. Given the sum is 30, and we need at least two 9s to satisfy the mode condition, we start with 9 + 9 = 18.\n\n## Step 4:  Find a combination that satisfies all conditions.\nWe have 18 from the two 9s. The remaining sum needed is 30 - 18 = 12. To keep the median an integer not in the list and ensure the sum of 30, we need to distribute 12 across the remaining numbers. Since the median is the average of the two middle numbers for an even number of items, and it's not in the list, we can consider pairs of numbers that average to an integer not in the list.\n\n## Step 5:  Explore possible combinations for the remaining sum of 12.\nGiven the need for an even number of items and the median not being in the list, one efficient way to distribute the remaining sum is to use two pairs of numbers that average to an integer not in the list. However, considering the constraints and the need for the sum of squares, we should focus on the smallest possible set that fits all criteria.\n\n## Step 6:  Identify a specific combination that fits all given conditions.\nA possible combination could be having two 9s (for the mode), and then two pairs of numbers that sum to 12. However, since we need the median to be an integer not in the list and to keep the list as small as possible while meeting the sum of 30, we consider a simple distribution: two 9s, and then two other numbers that fit the remaining sum and median criteria.\n\n## Step 7:  Realize the necessity of a specific, simple distribution.\nGiven the constraints, a straightforward approach is to have the list as [9, 9, x, y] where x + y = 12, and the average of x and y is not in the list. However, considering the median must be an integer and not in the list, we actually look for a configuration where the middle values, when averaged, give a non-list integer.\n\n## Step 8:  Determine a specific, viable configuration.\nConsidering the sum and the median, a viable configuration that fits is having two 9s, and then two numbers that are equidistant from the median value, ensuring the median is an integer not in the list. This leads to considering numbers around the average of the remaining sum (12), which is 6. A pair that fits well is 5 and 7, as their average is 6, which is not in the list, and they sum to 12.\n\n## Step 9:  Calculate the sum of squares for the determined configuration.\nThe list is [9, 9, 5, 7]. The sum of squares is 9^2 + 9^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 = 81 + 81 + 25 + 49.\n\n## Step 10:  Perform the final calculation.\n81 + 81 + 25 + 49 = 236.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{236}$","false_positive":true}

Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.","ground_truth":55,"solution":"## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nLet's denote the elements in set $A$ as $a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n$. For each $a_i$, Bob can create multiple sets $B$ with $a_i$ as the maximum element. These sets include $\\{a_i\\}$ and all combinations of $a_i$ with any of the positive integers less than $a_i$.\n\n## Step 2: Counting Sets for Each Element in A\nFor $a_i$, the number of sets that can be created is $2^{a_i - 1}$ because for each positive integer less than $a_i$, there are two possibilities - it either belongs to the set $B$ or it does not. This is a basic principle of combinatorics where each element has two states, leading to $2^n$ combinations for $n$ elements.\n\n## Step 3: Summing Up All Sets for All Elements in A\nSince the total number of sets Bob can list is 2024, we need to find a combination of $a_i$ values that satisfy the equation $2^{a_1 - 1} + 2^{a_2 - 1} + ... + 2^{a_n - 1} = 2024$.\n\n## Step 4: Breaking Down 2024 into Powers of 2\n2024 can be broken down into powers of 2 to identify the possible values of $a_i$. We start with the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 2024, which is $2^{10} = 1024$. The remainder is $2024 - 1024 = 1000$. The next largest power of 2 less than or equal to 1000 is $2^9 = 512$. The remainder is $1000 - 512 = 488$. Continuing, $2^8 = 256$ fits into 488, leaving $488 - 256 = 232$. Then, $2^7 = 128$ fits into 232, leaving $232 - 128 = 104$. Next, $2^6 = 64$ fits into 104, leaving $104 - 64 = 40$. Then, $2^5 = 32$ fits into 40, leaving $40 - 32 = 8$. Finally, $2^3 = 8$ fits exactly into 8.\n\n## Step 5: Identifying Elements of A\nFrom the breakdown, we see that the elements of $A$ must correspond to the powers of 2 we used: $2^{10}, 2^9, 2^8, 2^7, 2^6, 2^5, 2^3$. Therefore, the elements of $A$ are $a_i = 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4$ because we add 1 to each exponent to get the actual value of $a_i$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculating the Sum of Elements in A\nThe sum of the elements in $A$ is $11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4$.\n\n## Step 7: Final Calculation\nPerforming the addition: $11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 = 55$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{55}$.
