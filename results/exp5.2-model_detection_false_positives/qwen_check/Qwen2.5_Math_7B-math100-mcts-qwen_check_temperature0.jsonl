To determine the domain of the function \\(\\log x^2\\), we need to identify the values of \\(x\\) for which the expression inside the logarithm is positive. The argument of the logarithm function must be positive because the logarithm function is only defined for positive arguments.\n2. First, consider the expression inside the logarithm: \\(x^2\\).
