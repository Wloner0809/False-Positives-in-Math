For the function to be defined, the denominator must not be zero:\n\\[\n\\log(2 - \\log(x-2)) \\neq 0\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\) in the equation \\( \\log(2 - \\log(x-2)) = 0 \\), we convert the logarithmic equation to an exponential equation:\n\\[\n2 - \\log(x-2) = 10^0 \\implies 2 - \\log(x-2) = 1 \\implies \\log(x-2) = 1\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\) in the equation \\( \\log(x-2) = 1 \\), we convert the logarithmic equation to an exponential equation:\n\\[\nx - 2 = 10^1 \\implies x - 2 = 10 \\implies x = 12\n\\]\nTherefore, \\( x \\neq 12 \\).\nThis step is correct.\n\n### Step 4: Combine all conditions\nCombining the results from Steps 1, 2, and 3, we get:\n\\[\n2 < x < 102 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x \\neq 12\n\\]\nExpressing this in interval notation, we have:\n\\[\n(2, 12) \\cup (12, 102)\n\\]\nThis step is correct.\n\nSince all the steps in the solution are correct, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{True}}\n\\]"}
{"id":"99","response":"To evaluate the solution, let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the side lengths and their arrangement:**\n   - The octagon has four sides of length \\(1\\) and four sides of length \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n   - The sides are arranged so that no two consecutive sides have the same length.\n\n2. **Visualize the octagon as a square with right triangles removed:**\n   - Since the octagon is equiangular, each internal angle is \\(135^\\circ\\).\n   - This implies that the octagon can be formed by removing four right triangles from the corners of a square.\n\n3. **Determine the side length of the square:**\n   - Let the side length of the square be \\(s\\).\n   - Each right triangle has legs of length \\(x\\).\n   - The side lengths of the octagon are \\(s - 2x\\) (for the sides of length \\(1\\)) and \\(x\\sqrt{2}\\) (for the sides of length \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\)).\n\n4. **Set up and solve the equations:**\n   - From \\(x\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), we get \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n   - Substitute \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) into \\(s - 2x = 1\\) to get \\(s - 1 = 1\\), so \\(s = 2\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the area of the square:**\n   - The area of the square is \\(s^2 = 2^2 = 4\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the area of the triangles:**\n   - The area of each right triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times x \\times x = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{8}\\).\n   - The total area of the four triangles is \\(4 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n7. **Calculate the area of the octagon:**\n   - The area of the octagon is the area of the square minus the total area of the triangles: \\(4 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}\\).\n\nThe solution is correct and follows all the logical steps without any errors.
