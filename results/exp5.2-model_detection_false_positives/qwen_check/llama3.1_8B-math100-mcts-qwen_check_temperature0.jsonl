The correct approach is to factor the inequality \\( x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0 \\) as \\((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\\), which gives the solution \\( -\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3} \\). However, we must also consider the inequality \\( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \\), which is always true for all real \\( x \\). Therefore, the correct solution is the intersection of the intervals where \\( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \\) and \\( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \\), which is \\( -\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3} \\). However, we must also consider the inequality \\( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \\), which is equivalent to \\( (x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0 \\), which gives the solution \\( -\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3} \\).

{"id":"66","response":"To determine the correctness of the solution, let's analyze each step in detail.\n\n**Step 1: Find the vertex of the parabola.**\nThe parabola is given by the equation \\(x^2 = 8y\\), which can be rewritten as \\(y = \\frac{1}{8}x^2\\). The vertex of a parabola given by \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) is at the point \\(\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}, f\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)\\right)\\), so the vertex of this parabola will be at \\(\\left(0, 0\\right)\\).\nThis step is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the equation of the line that passes through the vertex of the parabola and makes an angle of \\(60^\\circ\\) with the \\(x\\)-axis.**\nWe want to find the equation of the line that goes through the point \\(\\left(0, 0\\right)\\) and makes an angle of \\(60^\\circ\\) with the \\(x\\)-axis. The slope of this line is equal to the tangent of the angle, which is \\(\\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3}\\). Therefore, the equation of the line is \\(y = \\sqrt{3}x\\).\nThis step is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Find the point of intersection of the parabola and the line.**\nWe can find the intersection of the parabola \\(y = \\frac{1}{8}x^2\\) and the line \\(y = \\sqrt{3}x\\). Equating the two expressions for \\(y\\), we have \\(\\frac{1}{8}x^2 = \\sqrt{3}x\\). Multiplying both sides by 8, we get \\(x^2 = 8\\sqrt{3}x\\). Rearranging, we have \\(x^2 - 8\\sqrt{3}x = 0\\). Factoring out \\(x\\), we have \\(x(x - 8\\sqrt{3}) = 0\\). Therefore, \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = 8\\sqrt{3}\\). However, since the line passes through the origin, we discard \\(x = 0\\). Solving \\(x = 8\\sqrt{3}\\) for \\(y\\), we have \\(y = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot 8\\sqrt{3} = 24\\). Therefore, the intersection point is \\((8\\sqrt{3}, 24)\\).\nThis step is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Find the length of the side of the equilateral triangle.**\nThe distance between the vertex of the parabola and the point of intersection is the side length of the equilateral triangle. The distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by the formula \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). Therefore, the side length of the equilateral triangle is \\(\\sqrt{(8\\sqrt{3} - 0)^2 + (24 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{192 + 576} = \\sqrt{768}\\).\nThis step is correct.\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the side length of the equilateral triangle.**\nThe side length of the equilateral triangle is \\(\\sqrt{768}\\). This can be simplified as \\(\\sqrt{768} = \\sqrt{64 \\cdot 12} = \\sqrt{64} \\cdot \\sqrt{12} = 8 \\cdot \\sqrt{12} = 8 \\cdot \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 3} = 8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 16\\sqrt{3}\\). Therefore, the side length of the equilateral triangle is \\(16\\sqrt{3}\\).\nThis step is correct.\n\nSince all the steps in the solution are correct, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{16\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct, and the output should be \\(\\boxed{\\text{True}}\\)."}

{"id":"98","response":"To determine the correctness of the solution, let's analyze each step in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the restrictions imposed by the denominator of the function\nThe denominator of the function is \\(\\log(2-\\log(x-2))\\). Since the base 10 logarithm function is defined only for positive real numbers, we need \\(2-\\log(x-2) > 0\\). Solving this inequality:\n\\[\n2 > \\log(x-2) \\implies 10^2 > x-2 \\implies 100 > x-2 \\implies x < 102.\n\\]\nSo, the restriction from this step is \\(x < 102\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the restrictions imposed by the domain of the logarithm function inside the logarithm\nThe expression \\(\\log(x-2)\\) must be defined, meaning \\(x-2 > 0\\). Solving this inequality:\n\\[\nx > 2.\n\\]\nSo, the restriction from this step is \\(x > 2\\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the restrictions imposed by the denominator of the function\nThe denominator of the function cannot be zero, so \\(\\log(2-\\log(x-2)) \\neq 0\\). This means that \\(2-\\log(x-2) \\neq 10^0 = 1\\), so \\(\\log(x-2) \\neq 1\\). Since the logarithm function is strictly increasing, this inequality is equivalent to \\(x-2 \\neq 10^1 = 10\\), so \\(x \\neq 12\\).\nSo, the restriction from this step is \\(x \\neq 12\\).\n\n### Step 4: Combine the restrictions imposed by the function\nCombining the restrictions from steps 1, 2, and 3, we find that the domain of the function is the set of all \\(x\\) such that \\(x > 2\\), \\(x < 102\\), and \\(x \\neq 12\\). In interval notation, this is \\((2,12) \\cup (12,102)\\).\n\n### Step 5: Express the domain in interval notation\nThe domain of the function is \\((2,12) \\cup (12,102)\\).\n\nThe solution provided in the problem is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{True}}\n\\]"}
