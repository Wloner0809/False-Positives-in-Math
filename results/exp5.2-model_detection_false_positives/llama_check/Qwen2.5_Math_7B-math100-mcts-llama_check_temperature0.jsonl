{"id":"4","response":"## Step 1: Review the problem statement and the given solution\nThe problem asks to find the result of rotating the complex number $z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i$ around the complex number $c = 2 - 3i$ by $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ counter-clockwise.\n\n## Step 2: Verify the formula used for rotation of a complex number\nThe solution uses the formula $w = c + (z - c) e^{i\\theta}$, which is correct for rotating a complex number $z$ around a point $c$ by an angle $\\theta$.\n\n## Step 3: Check the calculation of $e^{i\\theta}$\nThe solution calculates $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}} = \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4} + i\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, which is correct.\n\n## Step 4: Verify the calculation of $z - c$\nThe solution calculates $z - c = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i$, which is correct.\n\n## Step 5: Check the multiplication of $(z - c)$ and $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$\nThe solution multiplies $(z - c)$ and $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$ using the distributive property and simplifies the result to $4 - 2i$, which is correct.\n\n## Step 6: Verify the final calculation of $w$\nThe solution adds $c$ to the result of the multiplication and obtains $w = 6 - 5i$, which is correct.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\text{True}}$"}
{"id":"5","response":"## Step 1: Analyze the given geometric configuration\nThe problem states that $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through $A$, and $AB = BC$. This implies that $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles with $AB = BC$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the given angle and the angle to be found\nWe are given that $\\angle BAC = 124^\\circ$ and we need to find the measure of $x$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the properties of parallel lines and isosceles triangles\nSince $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through $A$, the angle formed by the segment through $A$ with $\\overline{BC}$ is equal to $\\angle ABC$. Let's denote the angles at $B$ and $C$ as $\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB = y$.\n\n## Step 4: Write the equation for the sum of angles in a triangle\nThe sum of the angles in any triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we can write the equation:\n$\\angle BAC + \\angle ABC + \\angle ACB = 180^\\circ$\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the given values and simplify the equation\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n$124^\\circ + y + y = 180^\\circ$\nSimplifying, we find:\n$124^\\circ + 2y = 180^\\circ$\nSubtracting $124^\\circ$ from both sides, we get:\n$2y = 56^\\circ$\nDividing both sides by 2, we find:\n$y = 28^\\circ$\n\n## Step 6: Find the value of $x$\nSince $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through $A$, the angle formed by the segment through $A$ with $\\overline{BC}$ is equal to $\\angle ABC$. Therefore, $x = y$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the final answer\nThus, we have:\n$x = 28^\\circ$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\text{True}}$"}
