{"id":"5","response":"## Step 1: Analyze the given geometric configuration\nThe problem states that $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through $A$, and $AB = BC$. This implies that $\\triangle ABC$ is an isosceles triangle with $AB = BC$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the given angle and the relationship between angles\nThe angle given is $124^\\circ$, which is the angle at vertex $A$. Since $AB = BC$, the base angles $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle ACB$ are equal. Let's denote the measure of each base angle by $y$.\n\n## Step 3: Write the equation for the sum of the angles in $\\triangle ABC$\nThe sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we can write the equation:\n\\[\n124^\\circ + y + y = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\\[\n124^\\circ + 2y = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\n## Step 5: Solve for $y$\nSubtracting $124^\\circ$ from both sides, we obtain:\n\\[\n2y = 56^\\circ\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 2, we find:\n\\[\ny = 28^\\circ\n\\]\n\n## Step 6: Determine the value of $x$\nSince $y$ is the measure of $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle ACB$, and $\\overline{BC}$ is parallel to the segment through $A$, the angle $x$ is equal to $\\angle ACB$ (alternate interior angles are equal). Therefore, $x = 28^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 7: Verify the correctness of the solution\nThe solution correctly applies the properties of isosceles triangles and parallel lines to find the value of $x$. The calculations are accurate, and the conclusion is logically consistent.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\text{True}}$"}
